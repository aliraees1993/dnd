# DND

## To build

`yarn`

## To run

`yarn start`

## Fill in the blanks

-- In components/TextWithGaps/index.tsx line 28-36 can be replaced with Inpput component to extend it to fill in the blanks.

-- Another idea i got for fill in the blanks was to use selection api to give the user an option to highlight the blanks and then the component will make the highligthed text into fill in the blanks exercise
